                                    <p>The purpose of the assessment is to conduct an objective assessment of  change management in an actual organisation and analyse it through the lens of the change kaleidoscope model ( hereafter CKM) which is central to this module.   The focus was to test the extent to which the model can be operationalised in an applied business context. 
                                        We decided to focus on an Aviation company based in Dublin Ireland.

                                    <p>The purpose of this study was to undertake an in-depth assessment of X Aviation Company change management strategy, as analysed through the lens of the change kaleidoscope model. As a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the organisation is presently adapting to the ‘new ways’ of work, and planning the implementation of a hybrid work model which involves both remote and on-premise operations. 
                                        The data captured from our analysis focuses on employee engagement, innovation and performance management, three areas which have been identified as key priorities for company X. Primary research has been conducted by engaging in virtual interviews with employees at various levels of company X while a broad array of sources were utilised in terms of secondary research, as outlined in our report. The key findings that emerge from our analysis is as follows:
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Employee Engagement:</span><br>Nurturing and maintaining high employee engagement has proven challenging for company X in the current remote work environment, particularly at the lowest, business analyst level. The root cause of this issue however, has been identified as a lack of engagement at the mid-level which has trickled down the hierarchy. Having probed further, issues around employee connection, recognition and trust, or a lack thereof began to emerge. Regarding connection, it has been found that low-level analysts feel isolated as they work remotely, an issue that is owing to the lack of informal social interactions currently taking place. Insufficient recognition of an individual's work also appears to have a negative impact on both engagement and morale while a lack of autonomy within employees’ roles has served to reduce the level of trust between company X ‘s managers and employees.
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Innovation:</span><br>Under the current circumstances, social categorisation is an issue for company X whereby individuals are creating social categories based on the differences and similarities amongst them, which serves to inhibit innovation. Difficulty has also arisen in maintaining the balance of connection between those in the office and those operating from home, an issue which runs the risk of two organisational cultures emerging among both facets of the workforce. Furthermore, the lack of psychological safety is also problematic for company X, with lower-level employees being reluctant to share their views and opinions with that of senior management. This, along with a lack of feedback from leaders has negatively impacted the overall level of innovation in the firm. 
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Performance Management:</span><br>Several issues within the current performance management system have been unearthed and are in need of adjustment to ensure fairness and credibility in the new remote context. These issues include an excessive emphasis on past performance, an over reliance on 360-degree feedback tools along with ineffective, yearly performance reviews. This system is not only outdated, but is also vulnerable to various forms of rater bias which may distort results.
                                        Based on our analysis of these issues, three key recommendations have been formulated. Firstly, it is advised that mid-level managers are converted into purpose-driven leaders by fostering a sense of connection, increasing non-financial recognition, and building trust to improve employee engagement. Secondly, psychological safety must be created through the provision of ongoing feedback, and the facilitation of information sharing, both of which are essential to maintaining company X’s innovative culture. Lastly, transitioning from a system of performance management to that of development is imperative to ensuring a fair and credible system which ensures that employees develop and maintain high performance. This can be achieved by establishing clear role expectations, embracing performance snapshots and conducting weekly check-ins with employees.
