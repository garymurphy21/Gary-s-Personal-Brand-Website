                                    <p>Following the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) published on the 24th of December 2020, many Irish businesses are encountering significant challenges and business disruptions. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has compounded the challenges facing Irish companies. 
                                        For this report, primary research was conducted by engaging in virtual interviews, with a comprehensive survey placed online and distributed throughout the team's professional network across varying industries. In total, 22 interviews were performed with a total of 60 survey responses. Moreover,  for secondary research, a broad range of academic and reputable consulting reports was utilised. The overview of our research findings are as follows:
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Overall Challenges Irish Businesses Face Post-BREXIT:</span><br> Customs administration paperwork has caused an extra administrative burden for businesses. Custom border delays have effected supply chain operations. Stage 2 of the Border Operating Model regarding animal products and high-risk foods being subject to sanitary controls, which was due to commence on 1st of April 2021, has now been delayed until 1st of October 2021. Furthermore, Covid-19 has severely impacted business operations. Resultantly, cloud adoption has accelerated, with 52% of Irish businesses intending to increase their investment in cloud and data centre service. Covid-19 has forced customers to access services online, adding more pressure to supply chain operations. 
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Industry Challenges and Responses:</span><br> Seven industries were analysed in total. However, the report focuses primarily on the retail, pharma, financial and agricultural sectors. The feedback from our primary research (interviews and surveys) indicated that supply chain operations and businesses expansion were the main issues consistent across industries. 39% of businesses surveyed have experienced disruptions as a result of Brexit. Regarding cloud usage, 78% are utilising cloud but mainly for data storage and communication purposes. Secondary research relayed consistent information to that of our primary research that supply chain operations were most effected. In response, an assessment of business supply chain operations needs to be carried out. Moreover, cloud technologies adoption needs to be considered to improve operation resilience and enable end to end visibility and seamless market expansion. Separately, the financial services sector has benefited greatly. The IDA reported that over the last two years, Ireland had won 90 contracts where Brexit was the primary reason cited.   
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">How Cloud Computing Can Be Utilised To Overcome Such Challenges:</span><br> Based on the primary research carried out, a framework was created that outlines four capabilities of future supply chains. The main capabilities cited for future supply chain systems are (1) the migration from a multi-portal system to a single control tower for increased visibility, (2) architect for fresh and resilience to ensure an agile and robust infrastructure, (3) the transition from linear supply chains to a more integrated and connected network to receive real-time feedback and the ability to make informed decisions based on key insights and (4) the utilisation of advanced analytics and algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in captured data. Additionally, both Microsoft Azure and SAP cloud-based solutions can be leveraged to enable these capabilities. 
                                        
                                        <br><br><span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">Future Opportunities for Irish Businesses:</span><br> This paper identified distributed cloud, data analytics and security as the main drivers of future opportunities for Irish businesses. Distributed cloud models and edge are an opportunity to prepare for the next era of cloud computing by targeting location-dependent use cases. The distribution of storage results from the exponential rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge computing technologies. The distributed cloud enables companies to have cloud services physically closer, resulting in increased efficiencies, faster insights, and reduced costs, with the advantage of centralised control. As larger volumes of data continue to be captured, Irish businesses need to leverage data analytics to uncover trends, patterns and correlations in large amounts of raw data to drive data-informed decisions. Finally, as business processes become more digitalised, security is of utmost importance. As companies migrate more of their data and applications to the cloud, sensitive business information and intellectual property need maximum protection. This is an opportunity to build trust with customers.
